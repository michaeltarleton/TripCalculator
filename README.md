# TripCalculator

## Getting Started

1. Run `docker-compose up` _(...grab some coffee...)_
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

### Documentation

- Access Swagger at `http://localhost:8081/swagger`

## Beware

- When adding purchased items to friends, you must click the "check" icon to save your changes. Otherwise the calculation will be incorrect.

## Known Bugs

- When deleting items, then adding a new purchased item, all the original items get added to the array.
  - to fix this I would implement chained @Output() variables on the nested components to bubble up the delete event

## Todos

[] Add unit tests  
[] Change the ChangeDetectionStrategy to OnPush for the components that only rely on @Input() variables  
[] Change the "check" icon color when table row fields have been dirtied
